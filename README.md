# Document-QnA-System
This is a lightweight, interactive Question-Answering system that lets you upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content using natural language. Built using LangChain, Google GenAI embeddings, and Groq-hosted Gemma LLM, the app uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for accurate, context-aware answers.
